I will introduce a few useful R libraries that can be utilized for text analytic tasks. Also, I will focus on an important step in Chinese processing, namely, the word segmentation/tokenization, and show how to attend to this step in the pipeline. Finally, I will demonstrate a few potential applications of data analysis &amp; visualization with the help of the attractive informative graphs with R. Structure of the Workshop Environment Setup Loading Text Data Chinese Word Segmentation Applications Data All the data sets and the R scripts used in this workshop can be downloaded here as a zipped file: WorkshopHKSYU.zip. After downloading the file, please unzip the file and you will see a new directory, WorkshopHKSYU. In this directory, you will find all the R script files (WorkshopHKSYU/*.R) and a sub-directory (WorkshopHKSYU/demo_data) required for this workshop. Please double click the R script file to start your RStudio/R. Materials In the workshop notes, the text boxes in light blue refer to the R codes that you need to run in the R console. The text boxes in black background show the outputs of the code processing. We will follow this presentation convention throughout the entire notes. print(&#39;Hello! R!&#39;) [1] &quot;Hello!
